"""Sequential CBM training, stage 2: train only the class head.

Stage 1 (train_attr_heads.py) already produced good attribute heads. Here we
FREEZE everything except the class head and retrain just that head on a
class-balanced loader. The class head then learns to separate classes from stable,
accurate concept vectors instead of chasing a moving target and riding the majority
class.
