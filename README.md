# HemaScope

An AI-powered study tool for hematology morphology identification. HemaScope helps
clinical laboratory professionals and students learn to identify white blood cell
types by pairing each cell with a plain-English explanation of the morphological
features that support its classification.

## How it works

HemaScope is built on a concept bottleneck model (CBM) rather than a black-box
classifier. Instead of mapping an image straight to a label, it uses a shared vision backbone to feed 11 attribute heads, which predict morphological featurtes of the cell. Finally, those predictions and their confidence values are taken and fed to the classification head, which provides the classification prediction for the cell.

```
image → 11 morphological attributes (each with a confidence) → cell class → explanation
```


Because the explanation can only ever speak from the model's own predicted
attributes, it reports what the model actually observed on this cell, rather 
than regurgitating a rote textbook description of the cell.

## Study (quiz) mode

The demo runs as a quiz. HemaScope draws a real validation-set cell, you guess its
type, and then it reveals the answer along with the model's predicted morphological
attributes and a plain-English explanation of why those features fit the known-correct
classification. You can also browse a specific cell type to study it directly.

The explanation is always built for the known-correct label (the answer key), which is what 
makes it a reliable learning aid that connects the visible morphology to the classification.

## Running the demo

The demo is a Streamlit app:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt   # plus torch / torchvision for your platform
streamlit run app.py
```

It expects a trained checkpoint under `checkpoints/` and the standardized dataset
metadata under `metadata/`. The source datasets carry their own
licensing terms (see below), and model weights are produced by the two-stage training
in `scripts/` (`train_attr_heads.py` then `train_class_head.py`).

## Scope

- Phase 1 (current): WBC morphology on single-cell crops. The demo covers 6 classes
  drawn from the attribute-labeled subset; the full unified taxonomy spans 17 classes
  across six source datasets.
- Planned: a learned language layer (fine-tuned VLM) for more fluent explanations over
  the same faithful attribute bottleneck; RBC morphology and parasite detection;
  user-submitted microscopy.
